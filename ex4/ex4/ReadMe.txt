
Some Notes:
----------

The program has been tested with C++11, anyhthing older might not compile or cause unexpected behaviour.

In order to run the program please use main() inside ex4.cpp
You can find the code that the program "compiles" in 'program.txt'. Since almost anything is allowed in the given language, we have tested for the examples in the homework to make sure we get the desired errors.

Thank you and regards,
Michael and Mattan.
